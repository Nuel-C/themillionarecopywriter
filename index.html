        <p>
            Hi,
        </p>
        <p>
            Have you ever heard of the term “Salespage” before? If you have, that’s good! If not, hold on to your seat because it’s an idea that’s going to blow your mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Uchenna Bede and I want you to answer this simple question honestly:
        </p>
        <p>
            Have you ever wondered why people aren’t signing up to join your program? I mean maybe, a few people are hopping on your challenges but not the numbers you envisioned in your head. Have you ever wondered why that is?
        </p>
        <p>
            Well it’s not difficult and I will reveal the answer to you in just one moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is so obvious you will be shocked you and you’re going to think, why on earth didn’t I think of that?</p>
        <p>
            But first . . .
        </p><br/>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Why would I want to do such a thing?</h1><br/>
        <p>
            I don’t even know you . . .
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, my name is Uchenna Bede and I’m a copywriter for fitness coaches, and it is my job to ensure that my clients do not lose out on their profits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Basically I help fitness coaches, like yourself, protect their bottom line so they can focus more on growth and expansion.
        </p>
        <p>
            But it wasn’t always so.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have used my persuasive writing skill across almost all major industries in the last two years. And I learned something absolutely mind-boggling.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the fact that just about every other industry utilizes the power of copywriting to the utmost highs and they reap the benefit of profit protection and steady growth but . . .
        </p>
        <p>
            The fitness industry is just about oblivious to it!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have never heard the term “copywriting” then that’s part of the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            You probably have a generic enquiry form in your bio where leads come from. And are basically trading your services in the worst way possible. Sure you post client testimonials and daily motivation and helpful content and people praise you in the comments. . .
        </p>
        <p>
            But where are the sales?
        </p>
        <p>
            You just keep marketing continuously and there isn’t an end in sight
        </p>
        <p>
            And that’s why I’m doing this . . .
        </p><br/><br/>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">To Give you An Edge Over your Competition who are Essentially Oblivious to What it means to sell as opposed to Marketing.</h1><br/>
        <p>
            And there is a difference.<br/><br/>
            A small one . . .<br/><br/>
            But a difference nonetheless.<br/><br/>
            And the difference is SALES GETS THE JOB DONE!<br/><br/>
            While marketing “Mehh” is merely an interest “piquer”. It piques the interests of your prospects and garners their admiration but rarely does it garner their money. Which at the end of the day is what it all boils down to.<br/><br/>
            How many people can you help achieve their fitness goals in exchange for their money? Value for value. Right? Right.<br/><br/>
            So here’s the deal.<br/><br/>
            Remember I asked if you knew what a “Salespage” was at the beginning of this message?<br/><br/>
        </p>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">
            The answer to that is easy, a money generating machine! . . . Or if you like the ‘non-salesy’ term Value-generating monster.
        </h1><br/>
        <p>
            When I first got into copywriting, it was summer 2019, before the world turned to this post-apocalyptic mesh of the corona virus aftermath.<br/><br/>
            I just dropped out of college after eating a boatload of motivational content on YouTube. I was basically trying to change my life and become something greater than I had ever been before.<br/><br/>
            So I started to train my body.<br/><br/>
            I got into the gym. And shocked all of my friends with a 90day transformation. My goal was a total revamp of my life up till then, and I found the answer in two things; becoming a copywriter and transforming my body.<br/><br/>
            Simple!<br/><br/>
            I followed the giants. Simeon Panda, Mike O’hearn, Mike Rashid, Bradley Martyn etc . . .<br/><br/>
            And! Simultaneously began working on a career as a copywriter.<br/><br/>
            It should have been easy but my problem lay in the fact that while I could write persuasive copy for just about everyone on the planet, I couldn’t find someone I really want to write copy for, and it seeped out in my conversations with prospects.<br/><br/>
            I got an odd job here and there but it wasn’t what I knew I was capable of. <br/><br/>
            It’s obvious to me now, but to the 2019 version of me it was the story of the proverbial “needle in a haystack”<br/><br/>
            Long story short . . .<br/><br/>
            I finally came to my senses and realized that the fitness industry needed me way more for reasons I have already stated. . . <br/><br/>
        </p>
        <h1 style="text-align:center;">
            The most pressing of which is how oblivious it<br/> is to the magic that Salespage copywriting<br/> brings.
        </h1><br/>
        <p>
            With a Salespage your hard work is going to be cut in half, at least . . .<br/><br/>
            And the reason is twofold<br/><br/>
            First, you won’t need to court new customers before you can convince them to work with you. In-fact it will be the other way around. . .<br/><br/>
            They’ll be convinced before they get to even know you because that’s what a Salespage does. By the time your prospects are done reading from top to bottom, they’re going to feel like they knew your grandparents.<br/><br/>
            Second reason why your hard work will be cut in half . . .<br/><br/>
            A well written Salespage will work forever for you, as long as your offer doesn’t change, you don’t change and your values don’t change.<br/><br/>
            It is the most loyal, most owner oriented sales generator on the planet. And I’m guessing it’s why its been around for at least 100years.<br/><br/>
            So how does it work?<br/><br/>
            It’s an easy three step process!<br/><br/>
        </p>
        <h1>Step 1:</h1><br/>
        <p>
            You provide all the data necessary for your desired project by answering a simple questionnaire that will delivered to an email address you provide.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then you make a 30% deposit to show commitment, which is the only reason your project will be picked up in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
            This step is the most important because it will set the tone for the entire project. The better you can answer the questions (which I’m sure you will do well) the better the outcome.
        </p><br/>
        <h1>Step 2:</h1><br/>
        <p>
            We hop on an onboarding call!
        </p>
        <p>
            This call is for clarity purposes. Any doubts will be cleared out at the end of this 9minute call and you can be sure nothing will be missed in the making of your automated salesman.        </p>
        <p>
            This is the first “critical” step because it relies heavy on honest communication. But I’m certain it will be a breeze
        </p>
        <p>
            And finally . . .
        </p><br/>
        <h1>Step 3:</h1><br/>
        <p>
            This is the final step, and is where you receive the finished product.
        </p>
        <p>
            This step is only concluded once you’re satisfied with how your Salespage has turned out. And also once the remaining 70% of the entire fee paid.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then you go on to enjoy the incredible powers in your possession.        
        </p><br/><br/>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">
            It is so simple that even if you just heard the<br/> word “copywriting” for the first time today,<br/> you can do it.
        </h1><br/>
        <p>
            And protect yourself and your business from profit ruts.<br/><br/>
            So, in just a moment I’m going to make an offer to you.<br/><br/>
            Now, what I’m going to offer you is in the very early stages of development, which is a good thing and will be of immense benefit to you because . . .  <br/><br/>
            The goal currently is to build up a track record and garner case studies in the online coaching/fitness industry. And I’m sure it won’t be long before they start pouring in.<br/><br/>
            So, to iterate, the offer I will be revealing to you in just a moment is a super-early bird offer!<br/><br/>
            And before I reveal it, you should know who this offer is for.<br/><br/>
        </p>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">
            Who Is This For?
        </h1><br/>
        <p>
            So this offer is NOT for you if you are just starting out . . .<br/><br/>
            And for a good reason, you probably will not be able to drive enough traffic in order to let the page do its work unless you decide to invest in paid advertising.<br/><br/>
            This offer is also NOT for you if you’re comfortable with your current state of affairs . . .<br/><br/>
            And that means, if you’re perfectly fine with fluctuating income or maybe it’s not fluctuating (I honestly don’t know) but is something you’re happy with then this offer won’t be for you either.<br/><br/>
            And most important of all . . .<br/><br/>
            This offer is NOT for you if you’re going to micromanage your way through the entire process. . .<br/><br/>
            Now, I encourage my clients to share all the information they have, because that’s the only way we can achieve success but there is a line where your input crosses over into professional opinion which frankly you lack.<br/><br/>
            So this isn’t for you, if you’re going to take my role anyway. You should just do it on your own.<br/><br/>
            However!<br/><br/>
            This offer is for you if you’re fine with making a small investment in yourself that will yield fruit in time freedom and automated sales.<br/><br/>
            If that sounds like you, then allow me to introduce to you my copywriting service . . .<br/><br/>
        </p>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">
            The Millionaire Copywriter Path to Automated Sales.
        </h1><br/>
        <p>
            Now this is a no-nonsense service designed to provide you with the number one selling tool in the digital world. <br/><br/>
            Not emails. Not social media. But Salespages!<br/><br/>
            If you’ve read up till this point and I still have your attention, then you best believe it works. It’s what salespages do. They hold the attention of your customers and gets them to buy . . .<br/><br/>
            And hopefully after you finish going through this message, you will be inclined towards giving this service a chance for your benefit.<br/><br/>
            This service offers two packages! <br/><br/>
            And as I mentioned are in the super-early bird stage.<br/><br/>
            There are simply . . .<br/><br/>
        </p>
        <h1>
            1. A SalesPage [ <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">$4999</span> $499] 
        </h1><br/>
        <p>
            Basically you work with me and I will deliver to you a Salespage that will help you convert prospects on auto-pilot. No work needed. Plug and play. Set and forget!<br/><br/>
            Its as basic as they come and essentially what I have been rambling on since the beginning of this message.<br/><br/>
        </p>
        <h1>
            2. A Salespage + Email Copy [<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">$6999</span>  $1099]
        </h1><br/>
        <p>
            Just what it says! <br/><br/>
            If you have an email list, in addition to the Salespage, you will also get a set of 8 emails to back them up, and get the ball rolling for you. That way you get the max amount of traffic and max amount of conversions!<br/><br/>
            It takes the stress of running paid ads, writing 300words per email (2,400 words) and monitoring it all at the same time.<br/><br/>
            And it’s the same thing . . . Plug and play. Set and Forget!<br/><br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            So yeah!<br/><br/>
            In essence these are the two packages.<br/><br/>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <h3><li>A SalesPage [ <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">$4999</span>  $499]</li></h3>
            <h3><li>A Salespage + Email Copy [<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">$6999</span> $1099]</li></h3>
        </ol><br/><br/>
        <p>
            Whichever one pleases you, you will get and enjoy the benefits of.<br/><br/>
            Also keep in mind.<br/><br/>

            You don’t have anything to worry about. . . <br/><br/>
            The risk is essentially on me. Because your failure is my failure as a service provider. <br/><br/>

            PS.<br/><br/>
            If you have any doubts whatsoever, I understand. I don’t expect you to open up to a stranger that fast anyway.<br/><br/>
            However, keep in mind, that you’re still reading this. And that should at least tell you something about my competence and what this could potentially do for you.<br/><br/>
            There are only so many people I can work with at a time too, so I urge you, take the shot!<br/><br/>
